# Java Fundamentals

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance
[here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/language_intros/challenges/java/README.ed.md)_

Java is a very popular language in the software world. It can be used to build a lot of different kind of programs, including desktop, mobile and web applications. If you've previously learned a language like Ruby or Javascript, Java is going to feel really different in a number of ways - but nothing that you cannot learn!

In this module, you'll first see how to write and execute basic Java programs, and also learn about some important things such as how to use types and how to write tests using JUnit. You'll then build a more complex program (a CLI game) using object-oriented Java features.

## Learning objectives

* Test-drive a simple Java program.
* Explain the main differences between Java and a language like Ruby.
* Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

2. [Types and compilation](./main/02_compile_error.md)
3. [IDE setup](./main/03_ide.md)
4. [Testing with JUnit](./main/04_testing_with_junit.md)
5. [Building a word-guessing game - Part I](./main/05_challenge_game.md)
6. [Building a word-guessing game - Part II](./main/06_challenge_word_choser.md)
7. [Building a word-guessing game - Part III](./main/07_challenge_player_guess.md)
